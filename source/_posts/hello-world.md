Welcome to my Blog! this is my first Post. 

My name is Iphigenie Bera and I can't wait to share my knowledge, learning journey and bits of my life here. I am  currently pursuing my Undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Northwestern University with a minor in Data science and Engineering. I was born and raised in Rwanda before coming in the USA for my studies. 

I am interested in everything data: data engineering, data science, data analytics and software engineering. I believe in the power of data in making sound decisions and optimizing resources.

I will post articles about my  computer science journey in [articles](https://iphixli.github.io/articles/). you can look at my resume from navigation bar [resume](https://iphixli.github.io/resume). I will document by projects with code snippets and demos, if applicable in [projects](https://iphixli.github.io/projects). Feel free to browse my posts my tags [tags](https://iphixli.github.io/tags) or [categories](https://iphixli.github.io/categories) or track past post in the [archives](https://iphixli.github.io/archives).
