A react timer app that uses pomodoro technique.
<!-- more -->
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.[1] It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. In this project I followed the classic values 25 minutes and 5 minute break as default values and created a pomodoro timer clone using React web.

this project was part of final project in FreecodeCamp Front-end Development course, check their cool curriculum [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)(I am not sponsored, I can vouch for supportive cummunity there).

I leveraged scalable vector graphics (svg) its versatility properties in making shapes. the shape and number displays changes accordingly as the countdown starts.
