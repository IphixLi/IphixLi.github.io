## Introduction
React is one of powerful frontend frameworks when it comes to state management. Developed by Meta (former Facebook), React have an in-built state object which seamlessly manages display of your webapp according to interactions with your application.

in this project I used React to generate random quotes from an API as the user clicks on the button. the webapp is hosted for free on heroku.
